  "review_text": "Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!",
