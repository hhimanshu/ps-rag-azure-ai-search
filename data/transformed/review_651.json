  "review_text": "Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!",
