  "review_text": "The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.",
