The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
