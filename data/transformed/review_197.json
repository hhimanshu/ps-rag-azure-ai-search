  "review_text": "Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking.",
