  "review_text": "Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker.",
