  "review_text": "Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York. Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. We look forward to sharing your review with the team, and we hope that we will have the opportunity of having you as our guest very soon!Warmest Regards,The St. Regis Management Team",
