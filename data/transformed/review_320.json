  "review_text": "Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future",
