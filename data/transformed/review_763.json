  "review_text": "Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast. We will share your feedback with our team for review, and appreciate your thoughts. We hope to see you again soon.Kindly,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
