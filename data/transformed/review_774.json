  "review_text": "Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant.",
