  "review_text": "Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!",
