  "review_text": "We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P. Bunce, General Manager",
