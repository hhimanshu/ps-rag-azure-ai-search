  "review_text": "Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable.",
