  "review_text": "I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.
