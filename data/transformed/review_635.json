  "review_text": "The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com.",
