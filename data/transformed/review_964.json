  "review_text": "Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!",
