  "review_text": "Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable",
