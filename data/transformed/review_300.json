  "review_text": "Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar.",
