  "review_text": "From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.
