  "review_text": "Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal.",
  "review_title": "Nice to stay, but needs to be improved.",
