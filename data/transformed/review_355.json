  "review_text": "Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries",
