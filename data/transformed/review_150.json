  "review_text": "Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town.",
