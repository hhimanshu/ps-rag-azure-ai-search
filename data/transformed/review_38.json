  "review_text": "The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..",
