  "review_text": "Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out.",
