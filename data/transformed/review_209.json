  "review_text": "Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door.",
