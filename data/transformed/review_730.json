Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray",
