  "review_text": "Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.
