  "review_text": "Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building.",
