The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need.",
