  "review_text": "Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . .",
