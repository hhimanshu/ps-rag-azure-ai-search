  "review_text": "This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!",
