  "review_text": "Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum. Great area restaurants. Nice caf shop on the ground floor.",
