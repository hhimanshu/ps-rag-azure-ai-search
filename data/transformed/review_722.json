  "review_text": "Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager",
