  "review_text": "Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.",
