  "review_text": "Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
