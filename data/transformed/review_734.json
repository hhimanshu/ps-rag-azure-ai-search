  "review_text": "I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team",
