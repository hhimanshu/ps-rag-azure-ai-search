  "review_text": "We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area.",
