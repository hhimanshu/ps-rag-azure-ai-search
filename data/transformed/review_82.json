  "review_text": "Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!",
