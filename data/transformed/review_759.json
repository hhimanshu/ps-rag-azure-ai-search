  "review_text": "We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office",
