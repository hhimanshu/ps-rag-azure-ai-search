  "review_text": "This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again.",
