  "review_text": "Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location.",
