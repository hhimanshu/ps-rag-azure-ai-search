  "review_text": "The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs.",
