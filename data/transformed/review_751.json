  "review_text": "I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager",
