  "review_text": "Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!",
  "review_title": "Pleasant stay, normal facilities would have been nice but overall an excellent option for Vegas",
