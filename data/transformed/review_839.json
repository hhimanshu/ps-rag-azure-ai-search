  "review_text": "Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit.",
