  "review_text": "Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas.",
