  "review_text": "Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning",
