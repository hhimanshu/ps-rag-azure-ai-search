However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel.",
