  "review_text": "Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.",
  "review_title": "Stayed here for a week and our stay was great! We will definitely come back again for vacation.",
