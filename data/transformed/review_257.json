  "review_text": "Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.",
