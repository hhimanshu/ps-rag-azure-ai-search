  "review_text": "Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows.",
