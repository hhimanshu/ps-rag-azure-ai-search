  "review_text": "Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
