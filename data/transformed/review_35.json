  "review_text": "My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!",
