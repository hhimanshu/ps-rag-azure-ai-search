  "review_text": "I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly.",
