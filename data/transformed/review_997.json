  "review_text": "Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient.",
