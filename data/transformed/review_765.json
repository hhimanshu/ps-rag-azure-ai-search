  "review_text": "If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast. We greatly appreciate your feedback and will share your comments with our team.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager",
