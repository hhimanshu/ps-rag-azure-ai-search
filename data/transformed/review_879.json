  "review_text": "Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie.",
