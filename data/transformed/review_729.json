  "review_text": "We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback.
