  "review_text": "The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect.",
