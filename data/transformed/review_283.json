  "review_text": "Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices.",
