  "review_text": "Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.",
