  "review_text": "I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in. But the another representative told me that Check-intime start from 16:00.16:00 2nd challenge to check-in. new another representative said the inspection of your room hasn't complete yet. wait for several minute the long line made by waiting check-in people were appeared from this time. 16:15 3rd challenge to check-in. next another representative said the inspection isn't yet.wait for 5-10min. I answered OK,I wait for at here(front desk) the long line has become much longer.16:50 4th challenge to check-in. no one tell me anything.I try to talk to another person who stand the next of front desk I am waiting for 45 minutes,Whyto tell you the truth,I had expected this time a little.because I thought this waiting time was the time to find the highfloor room I requested. 17:00 check-in done.the room assigned to me was...the most lowest floor(3rd).there are 20 floors in this hotel and I had requested higher floorsince 2 month ago,But the answer was the most lowest level.I was so sad...so sad. the attached picture is the View from this room.If the assigned floor was 4th floor,I think I was saved from this sadness.But 3rd...the most lowest floor to the guest who request high floor.I know this season is very busy.I don't want to complain more than that.The hospitality and smile of their staffs were very good.I'll stay this hotel again.maybe this month.Dear 376masatot, Thank you very much for feedback about your recent stay with us. I am terribly sorry to hear about your arrival experience and that your request for a room on a high floor could not be fulfilled. This is definitely not a typical St. Regis experience and on behalf of the entire team I would like to sincerely apologize. We would love for an opportunity to welcome you back to our hotel and show you our true five star service, so please do not hesitate to contact me directly at Melanie.rehbeinstregis.com for anything I may assist with. Sincerely, Melanie RehbeinDirector of RoomsSt. Regis New York",
