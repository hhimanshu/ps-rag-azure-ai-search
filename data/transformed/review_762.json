  "review_text": "I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager",
