  "review_text": "Bad: The water wasn't super hot the first day (maybe it was time of day) and there was no way to adjust the temperature of the room. Good: The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were quaint but classy. Loved the balcony. The in-room wine selection was pretty neat. I'll definitely come back to experience more of what they have to offer.",
