  "review_text": "Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff.",
