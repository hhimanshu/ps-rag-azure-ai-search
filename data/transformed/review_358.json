  "review_text": "Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!",
