  "review_text": "Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life",
