  "review_text": "My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !",
